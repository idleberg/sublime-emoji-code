## Usage

All emojis are prefixed with `ji`, following the string of the official [Unicode terminology](unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html).

**Examples:**

Let's say, you want to insert the üòÑ  emoji

* HTML: `ji:grinning-face` becomes `&#x1F600;`
* CSS: `ji:grinning-face` becomes `content: '\1F600';`
* JavaScript: `ji:grinning-face` becomes `u\1F600`
* Ruby: `ji:grinning-face` becomes `\u{1F600}`

Keep in mind that Sublime Text supports fuzzy completion, inviting you to use abbreviation of your preference.
